## Objective

After completing this homework, you should have four new files in this repo: `googling.md`, `terminal.md`, `github.md` and `forking.md`. Push your `answer` branch up for a PR review no later than Thursday. 

If you finish early with this homework, go ahead and prepare for [next week](https://github.com/wearecodets/phase-two/tree/master/week-two). It will be a pretty packed week, especially if you are new to programming.

## Directions

### 1. Googling

Read the section titled [Googling](http://mod0.turing.io/session2/#findinganswers) and answer the three questions in the blue box called ***Try It: Writing Google-able Phrases***. Create a new file called `googling.md` in this repo and write your answers there. 

> By the way, the extension `.md` represents Markdown files — [read more](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) if you are curious.

### 2. Command Line

Read the section titled [Terminal and Command Line](http://mod0.turing.io/session3/#terminalcommandline) and answer the blue box questions in [#5](http://mod0.turing.io/session3/#5-get-out-of-a-directory-cd-) and [#10](http://mod0.turing.io/session3/#10-remove-a-directory-and-its-contents-rm--rf). Again, create another file called `terminal.md` in this repo and write your answers there. 

### 3. Github

Read the section titled [Create a Remote Repo on Github](http://mod0.turing.io/session4/#creating-a-remote-repo-on-github) and follow steps 1-7. When you come to step #5, do the ***…or create a new repository on the command line*** part instead. When finished, create a new file called `github.md` in this repo and write the URL of your new repo there. 

### 4. Forking

Read the section titled [Forking](http://mod0.turing.io/session4/#forking) and do the exercise in the blue box labeled ***Try It: Forking*** (6 steps). Repeat steps 4-6 twice to the `birds.txt` and `fish.txt` files. When finished, create a new file called `forking.md` in this repo and write the URL of your forked repo there. # 404-not-found
